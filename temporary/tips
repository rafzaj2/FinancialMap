sudo ldconfig (za≈Çaduje biblioteki po zainstalowaniu np. pistache)



The ldconfig Linux command creates the necessary links and cache (for use by the run-time linker, ld.so) to the most recent shared libraries found in the directories specified on the command line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories (/usr/lib and /lib). 

ldconfig checks the header and file names of the libraries it encounters when determining which versions should have their links updated. ldconfig ignores symbolic links when scanning for libraries.

ldconfig will attempt to deduce the type of ELF libs (ie. libc 5.x or libc 6.x (glibc)) based on what C libraries if any the library was linked against, therefore when making dynamic libraries, it is wise to explicitly link against libc (use -lc). ldconfig is capable of storing multiple ABI types of libraries into a single cache on architectures which allow native running of multiple ABIs, like ia32/ia64/x86_64 or sparc32/sparc64.

Some existing libs do not contain enough information to allow the deduction of their type, therefore the /etc/ld.so.conf file format allows the specification of an expected type. This is only used for those ELF libs which we can not work out. The format is like this "dirname=TYPE", where type can be libc4, libc5 or libc6. (This syntax also works on the command line). Spaces are not allowed. Also see the -p option.

Directory names containing an = are no longer legal unless they also have an expected type specifier.

ldconfig should normally be run by the super-user as it may require write permission on some root owned directories and files. If you use -r option to change the root directory, you don't have to be super-user though as long as you have sufficient right to that directory tree.
